# Compiling OCaml and Hardcaml code

The RTL (Verilog) used by various flows in this repo is written using the
[Hardcaml](https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml) library, which needs OCaml
installed to generate.

1. Follow the instructions in https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html to install
opam, the OCaml package manager
2. Install the OCaml 4.13.1 compiler. You might need to run

```
opam switch create 4.13.1
eval $(opam env) # to pick up relevant environment variables
```

3. Install the relevant OCaml dependencies

```
opam install . --deps-only
```

You might need to install extra packages (m4 gmp-devep libffi-devel
libgmp3-dev), especially on the AWS boxes. In ubuntu you can run the following
command. For Centos on the AWS boxes, use `sudo yum install`.

```
sudo apt-get install m4 gmp-devel libffi-devel libgmp3-dev z3 cargo
```

To check everything installed correctly

```
opam exec -- dune build
opam exec -- dune runtest
```

Now please continue to the relevant section listed [above](#zprize-submissions)
to build the top level designs from source.
